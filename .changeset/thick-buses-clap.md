Add GraphQL resolver support. `@nestbridge/core` statically analyzes `@Resolver()`/`@Query()`/`@Mutation()` classes and `@ObjectType()`/`@Field()` types to build selection sets and diagnostics; `@nestbridge/runtime` adds a `graphqlRequest` client; `@nestbridge/vite` gains a `resolvers` option that generates client-facing resolver stubs backed by it; `nestbridge` re-exports the new GraphQL API.
