# @nestbridge/unplugin

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- c7fe551: Fix `outputDir` resolving relative to `root` instead of the bundler's own project root. `root` now controls only where controllers, resolvers, and the bootstrap `main.ts` are discovered, while `outputDir` always resolves relative to Vite's `config.root` or webpack's `compiler.options.context`. This removes the need to widen `root` to a parent directory just to reach a bootstrap file that lives outside the client project, and fixes webpack builds that previously had no way to resolve their own project root at all.
- @nestbridge/core@2.1.1

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a21adfa: Add static detection of a global response-wrapper interceptor (`app.useGlobalInterceptors(...)`, composing multiple chained interceptors in registration order) and a global `@Catch` exception filter's error response body shape (registered via `app.useGlobalFilters(...)` or an `APP_FILTER` provider). Both are reflected automatically in generated client types with no configuration: a detected response wrapper reshapes the generated controller/resolver return types, and a detected error body is written to `nestbridge-error-body.d.ts` for use with the new `isNestBridgeError()` type guard exported from `@nestbridge/runtime`. Neither writes anything when nothing is registered, or the shape isn't exactly recognized.
