## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7336719: Add support for controller methods that return `Observable<T>` or `StreamableFile`. The analyzer now detects these return types (`ResponseKind`), the generated client requests a blob for streamed responses, and `@nestbridge/runtime` exposes `RemoteObservableResult`/`RemoteStreamResult` helper types alongside the existing `RemoteResult`.

## 1.0.1

- Refresh package READMEs to document GraphQL resolver support.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 4dea4e9: Add GraphQL resolver support. `@nestbridge/core` statically analyzes `@Resolver()`/`@Query()`/`@Mutation()` classes and `@ObjectType()`/`@Field()` types to build selection sets and diagnostics; `@nestbridge/runtime` adds a `graphqlRequest` client; `@nestbridge/vite` gains a `resolvers` option that generates client-facing resolver stubs backed by it; `nestbridge` re-exports the new GraphQL API.
