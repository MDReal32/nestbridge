# @nestbridge/core

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a21adfa: Add static detection of a global response-wrapper interceptor (`app.useGlobalInterceptors(...)`, composing multiple chained interceptors in registration order) and a global `@Catch` exception filter's error response body shape (registered via `app.useGlobalFilters(...)` or an `APP_FILTER` provider). Both are reflected automatically in generated client types with no configuration: a detected response wrapper reshapes the generated controller/resolver return types, and a detected error body is written to `nestbridge-error-body.d.ts` for use with the new `isNestBridgeError()` type guard exported from `@nestbridge/runtime`. Neither writes anything when nothing is registered, or the shape isn't exactly recognized.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7336719: Add support for controller methods that return `Observable<T>` or `StreamableFile`. The analyzer now detects these return types (`ResponseKind`), the generated client requests a blob for streamed responses, and `@nestbridge/runtime` exposes `RemoteObservableResult`/`RemoteStreamResult` helper types alongside the existing `RemoteResult`.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Refresh package READMEs to document GraphQL resolver support.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

### Minor Changes

- 4dea4e9: Add GraphQL resolver support. `@nestbridge/core` statically analyzes `@Resolver()`/`@Query()`/`@Mutation()` classes and `@ObjectType()`/`@Field()` types to build selection sets and diagnostics; `@nestbridge/runtime` adds a `graphqlRequest` client; `@nestbridge/vite` gains a `resolvers` option that generates client-facing resolver stubs backed by it; `nestbridge` re-exports the new GraphQL API.
